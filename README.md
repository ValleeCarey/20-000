This web project utilizes Flexbox and CSS Transitions to add some animations to an otherwise static web page to add some refinement.

These are the features:

•When you hover over the sidebar on the left, a menu opens which contains the Table of Contents.
•When you hover over a highlighted word in the text, a definition appears. See the words “phosphorescent” and “locomotion”.
•When you hover over the semi-transparent buttons at the bottom of the page, they turn opaque.
•When you hover over any link, it changes color.
